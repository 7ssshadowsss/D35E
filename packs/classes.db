Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>\n<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters\" rel=\"nofollow\">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a>).</p>\n<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>\n<h2>Spontaneous Casting</h2>\n<p>A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn’t prepared ahead of time. She can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-natures-ally\">summon nature’s ally</a>&nbsp;spell of the same level or lower.</p>\n<h2>Chaotic, Evil, Good and Lawful Spells</h2>\n<p>A druid can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity’s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>\n<h2>Orisons (Sp)</h2>\n<p>Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on&nbsp;Table: Druid&nbsp;under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Languages</h2>\n<p>A druid’s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>\n<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn’t take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>\n<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>\n<h2>Nature Bond (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/air-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Air</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/animal-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Animal</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/earth-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earth</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/fire-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fire</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/plant-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plant</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/water-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Water</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/weather-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weather</a>. Druids also have access to a set of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/archetypes/paizo-druid-archetypes/animal-and-terrain-domains\">Animal and Terrain Domains</a>. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid’s effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>\n<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Animal-Choices\">Animal Choices</a>. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>\n<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion’s Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>\n<h2>Nature Sense (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A druid gains a +2 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(nature) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;checks.</p>\n<h2>Wild Empathy (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>. This ability functions just like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy\">Diplomacy</a>&nbsp;check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.</p>\n<p>The typical domestic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animals</a>&nbsp;are usually unfriendly.</p>\n<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>\n<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.</p>\n<h2>Woodland Stride (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>\n<h2>Trackless Step (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>\n<h2>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that target plants, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blight\">blight</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/entangle\">entangle</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/spike-growth\">spike growth</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/warp-wood\">warp wood</a>.</p>\n<h2>Wild Shape (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any small or Medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;type. This ability functions like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape I</a>&nbsp;spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;or back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.</p>\n<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>\n<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains in levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elementals</a>, and plants. Each form expends one daily usage of this ability, regardless of the form taken.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;or a Small&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>. When taking the form of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>, a druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape II</a>. When taking the form of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>, the druid’s wild shape functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body\">elemental body I</a>.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>, a Medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape III</a>. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body\">elemental body II</a>.

When taking the form of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elemental</a>, the druid’s wild shape now functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/elemental-body\">elemental body III</a>.

In most adventuring groups, he works best in a supporting role. He can’t usually match the stealth of the ranger or the rogue, the spellcasting power of the cleric or the wizard, or the combat prowess of the barbarian or the fighter. However, he makes all the other characters better at what they do, and he can often fill in for another character when needed. For a typical group of four characters, the bard is perhaps the most useful fifth character to consider adding, and he can make a great team leader.</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:&nbsp;</strong>A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). Because the somatic components required for bard spells are relatively simple, a bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do).

Like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.</p>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p>A bard casts arcane spells drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-bard\">bard spell list</a>. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or music). To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-\">Difficulty Class (DC)</a>&nbsp;for a saving throw against a bard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: bard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score.</p>\n<p>The bard’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the bard’s choice. At each new bard level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on&nbsp;Table: Bard Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score (See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters\" rel=\"nofollow\">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a>).</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.</p>\n<p>A bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.</p>\n<h2>Bardic Knowledge (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A bard adds half his class level (minimum 1) to all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;skill checks and may make all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;skill checks untrained.</p>\n<h2>Bardic Performance</h2>\n<p>A bard is trained to use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;skill to create magical effects on those around him, including himself if desired. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier. At each level after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2 additional rounds per day. Each round, the bard can produce any one of the types of bardic performance that he has mastered, as indicated by his level.</p>\n<p>Starting a bardic performance is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, but it can be maintained each round as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>. Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires the bard to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed\">paralyzed</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a>, knocked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>, or otherwise prevented from taking a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;to maintain it each round. A bard cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;instead of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. At 13th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>.</p>\n<p>Each bardic performance has audible&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>, visual&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>, or both.</p>\n<p>If a bardic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear the bard for the performance to have any effect, and many such performances are language dependent (as noted in the description). A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened\">deaf</a>&nbsp;bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components.</p>\n<p>If a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the bard for the performance to have any effect. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded\">blind</a>&nbsp;bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with a visual component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components.</p>\n<p>List of Bardic Performances:</p>\n<div>\n<p><a id=\"TOC-Countersong-Su-\"></a><strong>Countersong (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a bard learns to counter magic effects that depend on sound (but not spells that have verbal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>.) Each round of the countersong he makes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;(keyboard, percussion, wind, string, or sing) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;skill check result for the save. Countersong does not work on effects that don’t allow saves. Countersong relies on audible components.</p>\n<p><a id=\"TOC-Distraction-Su-\"></a><strong>Distraction (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to counter magic effects that depend on sight. Each round of the Distraction, he makes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;(act, comedy, dance, or oratory) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion\">illusion</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-lllusion-Pattern\">pattern</a>) or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion\">illusion</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-lllusion-Figment\">figment</a>) magical attack may use the bard’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;check result proves to be higher.

Distraction does not work on effects that don’t allow saves. Distraction relies on visual components.</p>\n<p><a id=\"TOC-Fascinate-Su-\"></a><strong>Fascinate (Su)</strong>: At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fascinated\">fascinated</a>&nbsp;with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and capable of paying attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creatures affected. The Distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability.</p>\n<p>Each creature within range receives a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard’s level + the bard’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Cha</a>&nbsp;modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature’s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and observes the performance for as long as the bard continues to maintain it. While&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fascinated\">fascinated</a>, a target takes a –4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\">Perception</a>&nbsp;checks. Any potential threat to the target allows the target to make a new saving throw against the effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect.</p>\n<p>Fascinate is an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment\">enchantment</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion\">compulsion</a>), mind-affecting ability. Fascinate relies on audible and visual components in order to function.</p>\n<p><a id=\"TOC-Inspire-Courage-Su-\"></a><strong>Inspire Courage (Su)</strong>: A 1st level bard can use his performance to inspire courage in his allies (including himself), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities.

At 5th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +4 at 17th level. Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability. inspire courage can use audible or visual components.

These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;in place of a bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability.

When doing so, a brawler has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/two-weapon-fighting-combat\">Two-Weapon Fighting</a>&nbsp;feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;weapon group, or weapons with the “<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monk</a>” special feature.

At 15th level, she gains use of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/greater-two-weapon-fighting-combat\">Greater Two-Weapon Fighting</a>&nbsp;feat when using brawler’s flurry.</p>\n<h2>Maneuver Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;checks when performing that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;and a +1 bonus to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a>&nbsp;when defending against that maneuver.</p>\n<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>, gaining the above +1 bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;checks and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a>. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk#TOC-Maneuver-Training-Ex-\">maneuver training</a>&nbsp;increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grapple</a>&nbsp;at 3rd level and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>&nbsp;at 7th level, her bonuses to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grapple</a>&nbsp;are +2 and bonuses to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>&nbsp;are +1. If she then chooses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush\">bull rush</a>&nbsp;upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grapple</a>&nbsp;are +3, to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>&nbsp;are +2, and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush\">bull rush</a>&nbsp;are +1.)</p>\n<h2>AC Bonus (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, she gains a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus\">dodge bonus</a>&nbsp;to AC and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a>. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>\n<p>These bonuses to AC apply against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch</a>&nbsp;attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>, wearing medium or heavy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>\n<h2>Knockout (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>. She must announce this intent before making her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler’s level + the higher of the brawler’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;modifier) or fall&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>&nbsp;for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>&nbsp;target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>&nbsp;that does not provoke&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>. Creatures immune to critical hits or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>\n<h2>Brawler's Strike (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a brawler’s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold\">cold iron</a>&nbsp;and silver for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. At 12th level, she chooses one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. (This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;component cannot be the opposite of the brawler’s actual&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine\">adamantine</a>&nbsp;weapons for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;and bypassing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness\">hardness</a>.</p>\n<h2>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a brawler’s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>&nbsp;damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/dagger\">dagger</a>&nbsp;deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon’s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon’s base damage instead of her adjusted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>&nbsp;damage—this must be declared before the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;is made.</p>\n<h2>Awesome Blow (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 16th level, the brawler can as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;perform an awesome blow&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler’s choice, and it falls&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can’t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent’s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>&nbsp;in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/awesome-blow\">Awesome Blow</a>&nbsp;monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>\n<h2>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"attackParts":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Monk"},"sort":300001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/D35E/icons/skills/blood_11.jpg"}

In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;(including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.</p>\n<p>If the ranger chooses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid\">humanoids</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider\">outsiders</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from—those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>, the ranger’s bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>\n<h2>Track (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills#TOC-Skill-Checks\">skill checks</a>&nbsp;made to follow tracks.</p>\n<h2>Wild Empathy (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>. This ability functions just like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy\">Diplomacy</a>&nbsp;check to improve the attitude of a person (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills\">Using Skills</a>). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;bonus to determine the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid#TOC-Wild-Empathy-Ex-\">wild empathy</a>&nbsp;check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</p>\n<p>To use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid#TOC-Wild-Empathy-Ex-\">wild empathy</a>, the ranger and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>\n<p>The ranger can also use this ability to influence a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast\">magical beast</a>&nbsp;with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;score of 1 or 2, but he takes a –4 penalty on the check.</p>\n<h2>Combat Style Feat (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, a ranger must select one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger/ranger-combat-styles/\">combat style</a>&nbsp;to pursue.</p>\n<p>The ranger’s expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.</p>\n<p>The benefits of the ranger’s chosen style feats apply&nbsp;only&nbsp;when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.</p>\n<h2>Endurance</h2>\n<p>A ranger gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/endurance\">Endurance</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>\n<h2>Favored Terrain (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from&nbsp;Table: Ranger Favored Terrains. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;checks and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(geography),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\">Perception</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth\">Stealth</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills#TOC-Skill-Checks\">skill checks</a>&nbsp;when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Terrain-Ex-\">favored terrain</a>&nbsp;normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>\n<p>At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Terrain-Ex-\">favored terrain</a>. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;bonus in any one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Terrain-Ex-\">favored terrain</a>&nbsp;(including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>\n<p>If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Terrain-Ex-\">favored terrain</a>, the ranger’s bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.</p>\n<h2>Hunter's Bond (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;to grant half his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>\n<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>. A ranger who selects an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;can choose from the following list:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Badger\">badger</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Bird\">bird</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-camel\">camel</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Cat-Small\">cat (small)</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Rat-Dire\">dire rat</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Dog\">dog</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Horse\">horse</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Pony\">pony</a>, snake (<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Snake-Viper\">viper</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Snake-Constrictor\">constrictor</a>), or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Wolf\">wolf</a>. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose a shark instead. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;shares his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Terrain-Ex-\">favored terrain</a>&nbsp;bonuses.</p>\n<p>This ability functions like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druid</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger’s effective&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druid</a>&nbsp;level is equal to his ranger level –3.</p>\n<p>A ranger can select a antelope, baboon, bustard, capybara, elk, falcon, kangaroo,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/lizard/lizard-common\">lizard</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/lizard/lizard-giant-gecko\">giant gecko</a>), marsupial devil, ram, reindeer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake\">snake</a>&nbsp;(reef snake or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/snake/snake-cobra-spitting\">spitting cobra</a>), stag, trumpeter swan, thylacine, wolfdog, yak, or zebra as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>. If the campaign takes place in an aquatic environment, the ranger can choose an armorfish or reef snake. A falconer ranger can select a falcon companion instead of a bird companion.</p>\n<p>If the campaign takes place in an aquatic environment, the ranger can choose a stingray.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions/animal-companion-archetypes/ambusher-companion-archetype/\">ambusher</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions/animal-companion-archetypes/bully-companion-archetype/\">bully</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions/animal-companion-archetypes/daredevil-companion-archetype/\">daredevil</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions/animal-companion-archetypes/feytouched-companion-archetype/\">feytouched companion</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions/animal-companion-archetypes/precocious-companion-archetype/\">precocious companion</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions/animal-companion-archetypes/totem-guide-companion-archetype/\">totem guide</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions/animal-companion-archetypes/tracker-companion-archetype/\">tracker</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions/animal-companion-archetypes/verdant-companion-archetype/\">verdant companion</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions/animal-companion-archetypes/wrecker-companion-archetype/\">wrecker archetypes</a>&nbsp;are all particularly appropriate for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger\">ranger’s</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>.</p>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-ranger\">ranger spell list</a>. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.</p>\n<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-\">Difficulty Class</a>&nbsp;for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against a ranger’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters\">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a>). When&nbsp;Table: Ranger&nbsp;indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score for that spell level.</p>\n<p>A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-ranger\">ranger spell list</a>, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>\n<p>Through 3rd level, a ranger has no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>. At 4th level and higher, his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;is equal to his ranger level – 3.</p>\n<h2>Woodland Stride (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.</p>\n<p>Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.</p>\n<h2>Swift Tracker (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;to follow tracks without taking the normal –5 penalty. He takes only a –10 penalty (instead of the normal –20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</p>\n<h2>Evasion (Ex)</h2>\n<p>When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or no armor. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>&nbsp;ranger does not gain the benefit of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Evasion-Ex-\">evasion</a>.</p>\n<h2>Quarry (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, a ranger can, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills#TOC-Skill-Checks\">skill checks</a>&nbsp;while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus\">insight bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature’s type must correspond to one of his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>Camouflage (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth\">Stealth</a>&nbsp;skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn’t grant&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover\">cover</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment\">concealment</a>.</p>\n<h2>Improved Evasion (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 16th level, a ranger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Evasion-Ex-\">evasion</a>&nbsp;improves. This ability works like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Evasion-Ex-\">evasion</a>, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>&nbsp;ranger does not gain the benefit of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/rogue-talents/paizo-rogue-advanced-talents/improved-evasion-ex\">improved evasion</a>.</p>\n<h2>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex)</h2>\n<p>While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth\">Stealth</a>&nbsp;skill even while being observed.</p>\n<h2>Improved Quarry (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 19th level, the ranger’s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, and can now take 20 while using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus\">insight bonus</a>&nbsp;to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.</p>\n<h2>Master Hunter (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, make a single attack against a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;at his full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">attack bonus</a>. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger’s level + the ranger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;equal to the creature’s current&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"attackParts":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Ranger"},"sort":143750,"flags":{},"img":"systems/D35E/icons/items/weapons/longbow.PNG"}

Clerics are also proficient with the favored weapon of their deities.</p>\n<h2>Aura (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity’s alignment (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-evil\">detect evil</a>&nbsp;for details).</p>\n<h2>Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>A cleric casts divine spells which are drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-cleric\">cleric spell list</a>. Her alignment, however, may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A cleric must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>\n<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Cleric. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters\" rel=\"nofollow\">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a>).</p>\n<p>Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time at which she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells</strong>&nbsp;A cleric can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity’s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaotic, evil, good, and lawful descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>\n<h2>Orisons</h2>\n<p>Clerics can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on&nbsp;Table: Cleric&nbsp;under “Spells per day.” These spells are treated like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>\n<h2>Channel Energy (Su)</h2>\n<p>Regardless of alignment, any cleric can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of her faith through her holy (or unholy) symbol. This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted.</p>\n<p>A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creatures or to heal living creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see spontaneous casting).</p>\n<p>Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\" rel=\"nofollow\">Will</a>&nbsp;save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the cleric’s level + the cleric’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier. Creatures healed by channel energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total—all excess healing is lost. A cleric may channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier. This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A cleric can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect.</p>\n<p>A cleric must be able to present her holy symbol to use this ability.</p>\n<h2>Domains</h2>\n<p>A cleric’s deity influences her alignment, what magic she can perform, her values, and how others see her. A cleric chooses two&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domains</a>&nbsp;from among those belonging to her deity. A cleric can select an alignment&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;(Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if her alignment matches that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>. If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, she still selects two&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domains</a>&nbsp;to represent her spiritual inclinations and abilities (subject to GM approval). The restriction on alignment&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domains</a>&nbsp;still applies.</p>\n<p>Each&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;grants a number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;powers, dependent upon the level of the cleric, as well as a number of bonus spells. A cleric gains one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;spell slot for each level of cleric spell she can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a cleric can prepare one of the spells from her two&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>s in that slot. If a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;spell slot. Domain spells cannot be used to cast spells spontaneously.</p>\n<p>In addition, a cleric gains the listed powers from both of her domains, if she is of a high enough level. Unless otherwise noted, activating a domain power is a standard action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete listing of cleric domains can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">Cleric Domains</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spontaneous Casting</h2>\n<p>A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that she did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can “lose” any prepared spell that is not an orison or domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with “cure” in its name).</p>\n<p>An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity) can’t convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with “inflict” in its name).</p>\n<p>A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells (player’s choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric channels positive or negative energy (see channel energy).</p>\n<h2>Bonus Languages</h2>\n<p>A cleric’s bonus language options include Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"attackParts":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Cleric"},"sort":100000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/D35E/icons/items/inventory/badge-cross.jpg"}

They are also proficient with light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, but not with shields.</p>\n<h2>Alchemy (Su)</h2>\n<p>Alchemists are not only masters of creating mundane alchemical substances such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances#TOC-Alchemist-s-Fire\">alchemist’s fire</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances#TOC-Smokestick\">smokesticks</a>, but also of fashioning magical potion-like extracts in which they can store spell effects. In effect, an alchemist prepares his spells by mixing ingredients into a number of extracts, and then “casts” his spells by drinking the extract. When an alchemist creates an extract or bomb, he infuses the concoction with a tiny fraction of his own magical power—this enables the creation of powerful effects, but also binds the effects to the creator. When using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a>&nbsp;(alchemy) to create an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances\">alchemical item</a>, an alchemist gains a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Competence-Bonus\">competence bonus</a>&nbsp;equal to his class level on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a>&nbsp;(alchemy) check. In addition, an alchemist can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a>&nbsp;(alchemy) to identify potions as if using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-magic\">detect magic</a>. He must hold the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions\">potion</a>&nbsp;for 1 round to make such a check.</p>\n<p>An alchemist can create three special types of magical items—extracts, bombs, and mutagens. Bombs are explosive splash weapons, and mutagens are transformative elixirs that the alchemist drinks to enhance his physical abilities—both of these are detailed in their own sections below.</p>\n<p>Extracts are the most varied of the three. In many ways, they behave like spells in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions\">potion</a>&nbsp;form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by effects like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic\">dispel magic</a>&nbsp;using the alchemist’s level as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>. Unlike potions, though, extracts can have powerful effects and duplicate spells that a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions\">potion</a>&nbsp;normally could not.</p>\n<p>An alchemist can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts is given on&nbsp;Table: Alchemist. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;score, in the same way a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard</a>&nbsp;receives&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters\">bonus spells per day</a>. When an alchemist mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately becomes inert if it leaves the alchemist’s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping—an alchemist cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use (but see the “infusion”&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Alchemist/#TOC-Discovery-Su-\">discovery</a>&nbsp;below). An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before becoming inert, so an alchemist must re-prepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work—most alchemists prepare many extracts at the start of the day or just before going on an adventure, but it’s not uncommon for an alchemist to keep some (or even all) of his daily extract slots open so that he can prepare extracts in the field as needed.</p>\n<p>Although the alchemist doesn’t actually cast spells, he does have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/formulae-lists-alchemist\">formulae list</a>&nbsp;that determines what extracts he can create. An alchemist can utilize spell-trigger items if the spell appears on his formulae list, but not spell-completion items (unless he uses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/use-magic-device\">Use Magic Device</a>&nbsp;to do so). An extract is “cast” by drinking it, as if imbibing a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions\">potion</a>—the effects of an extract exactly duplicate the spell upon which its formula is based, save that the spell always affects only the drinking alchemist. The alchemist uses his level as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;to determine any effect based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>. Creating extracts consumes raw materials, but the cost of these materials is insignificant—comparable to the valueless material&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>&nbsp;of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements (alchemist extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement). An alchemist can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an alchemist must have an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the extract’s level. The Difficulty Class for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against an alchemist’s extract is 10 + the extract level + the alchemist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier. An alchemist may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract but not when he consumes it. An alchemist begins play with two 1st level formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional forumlae equal to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier. At each new alchemist level, he gains one new formula of any level that he can create. An alchemist can also add formulae to his book just like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard</a>&nbsp;adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs and time requirements. An alchemist can study a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard’s</a>&nbsp;spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard</a>, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An alchemist does not need to decipher arcane writings before copying them.</p>\n<h2>Bomb (Su)</h2>\n<p>In addition to magical extracts, alchemists are adept at swiftly mixing various volatile chemicals and infusing them with their magical reserves to create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their enemies. An alchemist can use a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert—their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the alchemist must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst—the alchemist can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster’s component pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day—once created, a catalyst vial remains usable by the alchemist for years.</p>\n<p>Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Throw-Splash-Weapon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Throw Splash Weapon</a>&nbsp;special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/point-blank-shot-combat\">Point-Blank Shot</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat\">Weapon Focus</a>. On a direct hit, an alchemist’s bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the alchemist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier. The damage of an alchemist’s bomb increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/vital-strike-combat\">Vital Strike</a>). Splash damage from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb’s minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a>&nbsp;save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Alchemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/Alchemist/#TOC-Discovery-Su-\">Discovery</a>&nbsp;ability) as they level up. An alchemist’s bomb, like an extract, becomes inert if used or carried by anyone else.</p>\n<h2>Brew Potion (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, alchemists receive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/brew-potion-item-creation\">Brew Potion</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. An alchemist can brew potions of any formulae he knows (up to 3rd level), using his alchemist level as his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>. The spell must be one that can be made into a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions\">potion</a>. The alchemist does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat.</p>\n<h2>Mutagen (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, an alchemist discovers how to create a mutagen that he can imbibe in order to heighten his physical prowess at the cost of his personality. It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. An alchemist can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time—if he brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, a mutagen that is not in an alchemist’s possession becomes inert until an alchemist picks it up again.</p>\n<p>When an alchemist brews a mutagen, he selects one physical ability score—either&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>. It’s a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes the alchemist to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting him a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus\">natural armor bonus</a>&nbsp;and a +4&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alchemical-Bonus\">alchemical bonus</a>&nbsp;to the selected ability score for 10 minutes per alchemist level. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist takes a –2 penalty to one of his mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>, it applies a penalty to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>. If it enhances his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>, it applies a penalty to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>. If it enhances his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>, it applies a penalty to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>.</p>\n<p>A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;save (DC 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier) or become&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated\">nauseated</a>&nbsp;for 1 hour—a non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another alchemist’s mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the “stolen” mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an alchemist drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.</p>\n<h2>Throw Anything (Ex)</h2>\n<p>All alchemists gain the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/throw-anything-combat\">Throw Anything</a>&nbsp;feat as a bonus feat at 1st level. An alchemist adds his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Intelligence_Int\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier to damage done with splash weapons, including the splash damage if any. This bonus damage is already included in the bomb class feature.</p>\n<h2>Discovery (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, and then again every 2 levels thereafter (up to 18th level), an alchemist makes an incredible alchemical discovery. Unless otherwise noted, an alchemist cannot select an individual discovery more than once. Some discoveries can only be made if the alchemist has met certain prerequisites first, such as uncovering other discoveries. Discoveries that modify bombs that are marked with an asterisk (*) do not stack. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual bomb. The DC of any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;called for by a discovery is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of discoveries can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries\">Discoveries</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Poison Resistance (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, an alchemist gains a +2 bonus on all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>&nbsp;against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison\">poison</a>. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and then again to +6 at 8th level. At 10th level, an alchemist becomes completely immune to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison\">poison</a>.</p>\n<h2>Poison Use (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Alchemists are trained in the use of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;and starting at 2nd level, cannot accidentally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;themselves when applying&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;to a weapon.</p>\n<h2>Swift Alchemy (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, an alchemist can create&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances\">alchemical items</a>&nbsp;with astounding speed. It takes an alchemist half the normal amount of time to create&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances\">alchemical items</a>, and he can apply&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;to a weapon as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>.</p>\n<h2>Swift Poisoning (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 6th level, an alchemist can apply a dose of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison\">poison</a>&nbsp;to a weapon as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>.</p>\n<h2>Persistent Mutagen (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, the effects of a mutagen last for 1 hour per level.</p>\n<h2>Instant Alchemy (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, an alchemist can create&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances\">alchemical items</a>&nbsp;with almost supernatural speed. He can create any alchemical item as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>&nbsp;if he succeeds at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a>&nbsp;(alchemy) check and has the appropriate resources at hand to fund the creation.

Each warpriest must choose a time when he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. A warpriest can prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Orisons</strong>: Warpriests can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on&nbsp;Table Warpriest. These spells are cast as any other spell, but aren’t expended when cast and can be used again.</p>\n<p><strong>Spontaneous Casting</strong>: A good warpriest (or a neutral warpriest of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing\">healing</a>&nbsp;spells that he did not prepare ahead of time. The warpriest can expend any prepared spell that isn’t an orison to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower. A cure spell is any spell with “cure” in its name.</p>\n<p>An evil warpriest (or a neutral warpriest of an evil deity) can’t convert spells to cure spells, but can convert them to inflict spells. An inflict spell is any spell with “inflict” in its name.</p>\n<p>A warpriest that is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil chooses whether he can convert spells into either cure spells or inflict spells. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. This choice also determines whether the warpriest channels positive or negative energy (see Channel Energy, below).</p>\n<p><strong>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells</strong>: A warpriest cannot cast spells of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;opposed to his own or his deity’s (if he has a deity). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaotic, evil, good, and lawful descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>\n<h2>Aura (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A warpriest of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura (as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>) corresponding to the deity’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-evil\">detect evil</a>).</p>\n<h2>Blessings (Su)</h2>\n<p>A warpriest’s deity influences his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. Each warpriest can select two blessings from among those granted by his deity (each deity grants the blessings tied to its domains). A warpriest can select an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;blessing (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;matches that domain. If a warpriest isn’t devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two blessings to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities, subject to GM approval. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.</p>\n<p>Each blessing grants a minor power at 1st level and a major power at 10th level. A warpriest can call upon the power of his blessings a number of times per day (in any combination) equal to 3 + 1/2 his warpriest level (to a maximum of 13 times per day at 20th level). Each time he calls upon any one of his blessings, it counts against his daily limit. The save DC for these blessings is equal to 10 + 1/2 the warpriest’s level + the warpriest’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>If a warpriest also has levels in a class that grants&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>&nbsp;domains, the blessings chosen must match the domains selected by that class. Subject to GM discretion, the warpriest can change his former blessings or domains to make them conform.<br><br>Blessings are here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/warpriest/blessings/\">Blessings.</a></p>\n<h2>Focus Weapon</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a warpriest receives&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat\">Weapon Focus</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat (he can choose any weapon, not just his deity’s favored weapon).</p>\n<h2>Sacred Weapon (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, weapons wielded by a warpriest are charged with the power of his faith. In addition to the favored weapon of his deity, the warpriest can designate a weapon as a sacred weapon by selecting that weapon with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat\">Weapon Focus</a>&nbsp;feat; if he has multiple&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-focus-combat\">Weapon Focus</a>&nbsp;feats, this ability applies to all of them. Whenever the warpriest hits with his sacred weapon, the weapon damage is based on his level and not the weapon type. The damage for Medium warpriests is listed on Table 1–14; see the table below for Small and Large warpriests. The warpriest can decide to use the weapon’s base damage instead of the sacred weapon damage—this must be declared before the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;is made. (If the weapon’s base damage exceeds the sacred weapon damage, its damage is unchanged.) This increase in damage does not affect any other aspect of the weapon, and doesn’t apply to alchemical items, bombs, or other weapons that only deal energy damage.</p>\n<p>At 4th level, the warpriest gains the ability to enhance one of his sacred weapons with divine power as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. This power grants the weapon a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>. For every 4 levels beyond 4th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). If the warpriest has more than one sacred weapon, he can enhance another on the following round by using another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. The warpriest can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his warpriest level, but these rounds need not be consecutive.</p>\n<p>These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the weapon might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can enhance a weapon with any of the following weapon special abilities:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/brilliant-energy\">brilliant energy</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/defending\">defending</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/disruption\">disruption</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming\">flaming</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/frost\">frost</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/keen\">keen</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/shock\">shock</a>. In addition, if the warpriest is chaotic, he can add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/anarchic\">anarchic</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/vicious\">vicious</a>. If he is evil, he can add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/mighty-cleaving\">mighty cleaving</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy\">unholy</a>. If he is good, he can add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/ghost-touch\">ghost touch</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/holy\">holy</a>. If he is lawful, he can add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/axiomatic\">axiomatic</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/merciful\">merciful</a>. If he is neutral (with no other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>), he can add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/spell-storing\">spell storing</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/thundering\">thundering</a>. Adding any of these special abilities replaces an amount of bonus equal to the special ability’s base cost. Duplicate abilities do not stack. The weapon must have at least a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;before any other special abilities can be added.</p>\n<p>If multiple weapons are enhanced, each one consumes rounds of use individually. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;and special abilities are determined the first time the ability is used each day, and cannot be changed until the next day. These bonuses do not apply if another creature is wielding the weapon, but they continue to be in effect if the weapon otherwise leaves the warpriest’s possession (such as if the weapon is thrown). This ability can be ended as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;at the start of the warpriest’s turn (that round does not count against the total duration, unless the ability is resumed during the same round). If the warpriest uses this ability on a double weapon, the effects apply to only one end of the weapon.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; margin: 10px; table-layout: fixed; border-color: #888888; min-width: 200px; color: #333333; font-family: Varela, sans-serif;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: #cfe2f3;\">\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<th class=\"text\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #888888;\">Level</th>\n<th class=\"text\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #888888;\">Damage(Small)</th>\n<th class=\"text\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #888888;\">Damage(Large)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1st-4rd</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d4</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: #f3f3f3;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">5th-9th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d6</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">10th-14th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d8</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">2d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box; background-color: #f3f3f3;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">15th-19th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">1d10</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">20th</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">2d6</td>\n<td class=\"number\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 2px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #888888;\">3d8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Bonus Languages</h2>\n<p>A warpriest’s bonus language options include Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal. These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.</p>\n<h2>Fervor (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, a warpriest can draw upon the power of his faith to heal wounds or harm foes. He can also use this ability to quickly cast spells that aid in his struggles.

By expending one use of this ability, a good warpriest (or one who worships a good deity) can touch a creature to heal it of 1d6 points of damage, plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every 3 warpriest levels he possesses above 2nd (to a maximum of 7d6 at 20th level).

Spells cast in this way ignore somatic components and do not provoke&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>. The warpriest does not need to have a free hand to cast a spell in this way.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Feats</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a warpriest gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feats</a>. The warpriest must meet the prerequisites for these feats, but he treats his warpriest level as his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;(in addition to base attack bonuses gained from other classes and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-\">Hit Dice</a>) for the purpose of qualifying for these feats.</p>\n<p>Finally, for the purposes of these feats, the warpriest can select feats that have a minimum number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;levels as a prerequisite, treating his warpriest level as his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;level.</p>\n<h2>Channel Energy (Su)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, a warpriest can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of his faith through his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/holy\">holy</a>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy\">unholy</a>) symbol. This energy can be used to deal or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted. Using this ability is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;that expends two uses of his fervor ability and doesn’t provoke an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>. The warpriest must present a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/holy\">holy</a>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/unholy\">unholy</a>) symbol to use this ability. A good warpriest (or one who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to heal living creatures or to deal damage to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creatures. An evil warpriest (or one who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or heal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;creatures. A neutral warpriest who worships a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) channels positive energy if he chose to spontaneously cast cure spells or negative energy if he chose to spontaneously cast inflict spells.</p>\n<p>Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead\">undead</a>&nbsp;or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the warpriest. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to the amount listed in the fervor ability. Creatures that take damage from channeled energy must succeed at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;saving throw to halve the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 the warpriest’s level + the warpriest’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier. Creatures healed by channeled energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total—all excess&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing\">healing</a>&nbsp;is lost. A warpriest can choose whether or not to include himself in this effect.</p>\n<h2>Sacred Armor (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 7th level, the warpriest gains the ability to enhance his armor with divine power as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. This power grants the armor a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>. For every 3 levels beyond 7th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level). The warpriest can use this ability a number of minutes per day equal to his warpriest level. This duration must be used in 1-minute increments, but they don’t need to be consecutive.</p>\n<p>These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the armor might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can enhance armor any of the following armor special abilities: energy resistance (<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor/magic-armor-and-shield-special-abilities/energy-resistance/\">normal</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor/magic-armor-and-shield-special-abilities/energy-resistance-improved/\">improved</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor/magic-armor-and-shield-special-abilities/energy-resistance-greater/\">greater</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor/magic-armor-and-shield-special-abilities/fortification/\">fortification</a>&nbsp;(heavy, light, or moderate),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/glamered\">glamered</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-armor/magic-armor-and-shield-special-abilities/spell-resistance/\">spell resistance</a>&nbsp;(13, 15, 17, and 19). Adding any of these special abilities replaces an amount of bonus equal to the special ability’s base cost. For this purpose, glamered counts as a +1 bonus, energy resistance counts as +2, improved energy resistance counts as +4, and greater energy resistance counts as +5. Duplicate abilities do not stack. The armor must have at least a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;before any other special abilities can be added.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;and armor special abilities are determined the first time the ability is used each day and cannot be changed until the next day. These bonuses apply only while the warpriest is wearing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, and end immediately if the armor is removed or leaves the warpriest’s possession. This ability can be ended as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;at the start of the warpriest’s turn. This ability cannot be applied to a shield.</p>\n<p>When the warpriest uses this ability, he can also use his sacred weapon ability as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;by expending one use of his fervor.</p>\n<h2>Aspect of War (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the warpriest can channel an aspect of war, growing in power and martial ability. Once per day as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, a warpriest can treat his level as his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>, gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>&nbsp;10/—, and can move at his full speed regardless of the armor he is wearing or his encumbrance. In addition, the blessings he calls upon don’t count against his daily limit during this time. This ability lasts for 1 minute.</p>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"attackParts":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Paladin"},"sort":1000001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/D35E/icons/skills/yellow_21.jpg"}

A bloodrager can cast bloodrager spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. This does not affect the arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes. Like other arcane spellcasters, a bloodrager wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has somatic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>.</p>\n<h2>Bloodline</h2>\n<p>Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in his family’s past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>When choosing a bloodline, the bloodrager’s alignment doesn’t restrict his choices. A good bloodrager could come from an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager/bloodrager-bloodlines/paizo-bloodrager-bloodlines/abyssal\">abyssal bloodline</a>, a celestial bloodline could beget an evil bloodrager generations later, a bloodrager from an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager/bloodrager-bloodlines/paizo-bloodrager-bloodlines/infernal\">infernal bloodline</a>&nbsp;could be chaotic, and so on. Though his bloodline empowers him, it doesn’t dictate or limit his thoughts and behavior.</p>\n<p>The bloodrager gains bloodline powers at 1st level, 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. The bloodline powers a bloodrager gains are described in his chosen bloodline. For all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-\">spell-like</a>&nbsp;bloodline powers, treat the character’s bloodrager level as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>.</p>\n<p>At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on&nbsp;Table: Bloodrager. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.</p>\n<p>If the bloodrager takes levels in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the bloodrager can change his former&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/Bloodrager/#TOC-Bloodline\">bloodline</a>&nbsp;to make them conform.</p>\n<p><strong>Bloodline Mutations</strong>: Although heirs to similar arcane bloodlines may share commonalities, the unique circumstances in which a bloodline enters a bloodrager or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer’s</a>&nbsp;lineage can result in the manifestation of particularly strange or unusual bloodline powers known as mutations. Whenever a bloodrager or a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>&nbsp;gains a new bloodline power, she can swap her bloodline power for a bloodline mutation whose prerequisites she meets. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed, and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager\">bloodrager</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>&nbsp;cannot swap a bloodline power that she has altered or replaced with an archetype for a bloodline mutation. A bloodrager need not be in a bloodrage to use her bloodline mutation powers. Alternatively, a bloodrager or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>&nbsp;can select a bloodline mutation in place of a bloodline bonus feat, provided her class level is at least equal to the level of the bloodline ability the mutation normally replaces.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer/bloodlines/bloodline-mutations\">The list of bloodline mutations can be found here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Bloodrager Bloodlines</h2>\n<p>When a bloodrager enters a bloodrage, he often takes on a physical transformation influenced by his bloodline and powered by the magic that roils within him. Unless otherwise specified, he gains the effects of his bloodline powers only while in a bloodrage; once the bloodrage ends, all powers from his bloodline immediately cease, and any physical changes the bloodrager underwent revert, restoring him to normal.</p>\n<ul class=\"ogn-childpages\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

The increase to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;grants the bloodrager 2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-\">Hit Die</a>, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points\">temporary hit points</a>. While bloodraging, a bloodrager cannot use any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>-,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>-, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>-based skills (except&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly\">Fly</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride\">Ride</a>) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>\n<p>A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>. When the bloodrage ends, he’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued\">fatigued</a>&nbsp;for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued\">fatigued</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted\">exhausted</a>, but can otherwise enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.</p>\n<p>Bloodrage counts as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian\">barbarian’s</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-\">rage</a>&nbsp;class feature for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects.</p>\n<h2>Fast Movement (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A bloodrager’s land speed is faster than is normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the bloodrager’s speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the bloodrager’s land speed.</p>\n<h2>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, a bloodrager can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed\">flat-footed</a>, nor does he lose his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to AC if the attacker is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Invisible\">invisible</a>. He still loses his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to AC if immobilized. A bloodrager with this ability can still lose his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Feint\">feint</a>&nbsp;action against him.</p>\n<p>If a bloodrager already possesses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">uncanny dodge</a>&nbsp;from a different class, he automatically gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Improved-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">improved uncanny dodge</a>&nbsp;(see below) instead.</p>\n<h2>Blood Sanctuary (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, due to the power of his blood, a bloodrager can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by himself or his allies. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that he or an ally casts.</p>\n<h2>Blood Casting (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains the ability to cast spells even while bloodraging. He can also cast these spells defensively and can make&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a>&nbsp;checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, he can cast and concentrate on only his bloodrager spells (see below); spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state.</p>\n<h2>Eschew Materials</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, the bloodrager gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/eschew-materials\">Eschew Materials</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat.</p>\n<h2>Spell Casting</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 4th level, a bloodrager gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/bloodrager\">bloodrager spell list</a>. To learn or cast a spell, a bloodrager must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. He can cast spells he knows without preparing them ahead of time. The saving throw DC against a bloodrager’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Bloodrager. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score. The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn’t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.</p>\n<p>The bloodrager’s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on&nbsp;Table: Bloodrager Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bloodrager knows is not affected by his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline.&nbsp;At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>.</p>\n<table style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;

These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">Combat Feats</a>, sometimes also called “fighter bonus feats.”</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bravery (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;saves against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Armor Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum –4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus allowed.</p>\n<p>In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Armor Training</strong>: Beginning at 7th level, instead of increasing the benefits provided by armor training (reducing his armor’s check penalty by 1 and increasing its maximum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus by 1), a fighter can choose an advanced armor training option (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Fighter/#Advanced-Armor-Training\">Advanced Armor Training</a>&nbsp;below) . If the fighter does so, he still gains the ability to move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor at 3rd level, and while wearing heavy armor at 7th level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Weapon Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<p>Every four levels thereafter (9th*, 13th, and 17th), a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.</p>\n<p>A fighter also adds this bonus to any combat maneuver checks made with weapons from his group. This bonus also applies to the fighter’s Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against weapons from this group.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Weapon Training</strong>: Beginning at 9th level, instead of selecting an additional fighter weapon group, a fighter can choose an advanced weapon training option (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Fighter/#Advanced-Weapon-Training\">Advanced Weapon Training</a>&nbsp;below) for one fighter weapon group that he previously selected with the

gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;5/— whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Advanced Armor Training</h2>\n<p>Highly skilled and tenacious fighters can gain advanced armor training, learning techniques and applications of the armor training class feature that give them special benefits in exchange for reducing their ability to mitigate their armor’s armor check penalty and improve its maximum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus.</p>\n<p>Advanced armor training options function only when the fighter is wearing appropriate armor or using a shield, unless otherwise noted. A fighter with an archetype that replaces armor training cannot select advanced armor training options.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Adaptable Training (Ex)</strong>: The fighter can use his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;in place of his ranks in one skill of his choice from the following list:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb\">Climb</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise\">Disguise</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist\">Escape Artist</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(engineering),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/profession\">Profession</a>&nbsp;(soldier),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride\">Ride</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim\">Swim</a>. The fighter need not be wearing armor or using a shield to use this option. When using adaptable training, the fighter substitutes his total&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;(including his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;gained through levels in other classes) for his ranks in this skill, but adds the skill’s usual ability score modifier and any other bonuses or penalties that would modify that skill. Once a skill has been selected, it cannot be changed and the fighter can immediately retrain all of his ranks in the selected skill at no additional cost in money or time. In addition, the fighter adds all skills chosen with this option to his list of class skills. A fighter can choose this option up to four times.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Specialization (Ex)</strong>: The fighter selects one specific type of armor with which he is proficient, such as chain shirts or scale mail. While wearing the selected type of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, the fighter adds one-quarter of his fighter level to the armor’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor bonus</a>, up to a maximum bonus of +3 for light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, +4 for medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or +5 for heavy armor. This increase to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor bonus</a>&nbsp;doesn’t increase the benefit that the fighter gains from feats, class abilities, or other effects that are determined by his armor’s base&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor bonus</a>, including other advanced armor training options. A fighter can choose this option multiple times. Each time he chooses it, he applies its benefit to a different type of armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Armored Confidence (Ex)</strong>: While wearing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, the fighter gains a bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>&nbsp;checks based upon the type of armor he is wearing: +1 for light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, +2 for medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or +3 for heavy armor. This bonus increases by 1 at 7th level and every 4 fighter levels thereafter, to a maximum of +4 at 19th level. In addition, the fighter adds half his armored confidence bonus to the DC of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>&nbsp;checks to demoralize him.</p>\n<p><strong>Armored Juggernaut (Ex)</strong>: When wearing heavy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, the fighter gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>&nbsp;1/—. At 7th level, the fighter gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>&nbsp;1/— when wearing medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>&nbsp;2/— when wearing heavy armor. At 11th level, the fighter gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>&nbsp;1/— when wearing light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>&nbsp;2/— when wearing medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>&nbsp;3/— when wearing heavy armor.

If he succeeds at the check, he is treated as having properly donned his armor rather than having hastily donned it. The fighter can also remove his armor in the same amount of time that it takes him to don his armor hastily. He can even remove sections of armor to escape grapples and similar grasping hindrances.

In effect, the inquisitor “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level inquisitor spell she can cast.

Although not as tied to the tenets of the deity as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>, an inquisitor must still hold such guidelines in high regard, despite that fact she can go against them if it serves the greater good of the faith. An inquisitor can select one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;from among those belonging to her deity. She can select an alignment domain only if her alignment matches that domain. With the GM’s approval, an inquisitor can be devoted to an ideal instead of a deity, selecting one domain to represent her personal inclination and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.</p>\n<p>Each&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">domain</a>&nbsp;grants a number of domain powers, depending on the level of the inquisitor. An inquisitor does not gain the bonus spells listed for each domain, nor does she gain bonus spell slots. The inquisitor uses her level as her effective&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>&nbsp;level when determining the power and effect of her domain powers. If the inquisitor has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>&nbsp;levels, one of her two domain selections must be the same domain selected as an inquisitor. Levels of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">cleric</a>&nbsp;and inquisitor stack for the purpose of determining domain powers and abilities, but not for bonus spells.</p>\n<p>A complete listing of domains can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains\">Domains</a>. Inquisitors also have access to Inquisitions, which are similar to Domains but do not include Domain spells.

Starting when the judgment is made, the inquisitor receives a bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment made.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, an inquisitor can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor can use this ability one additional time per day. Once activated, this ability lasts until the combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end. The inquisitor must participate in the combat to gain these bonuses.

As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, she can change this judgment to another type. If the inquisitor is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Evil\">evil</a>, she receives profane bonuses instead of sacred, as appropriate.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/additional-rules\">Neutral</a>&nbsp;inquisitors must select profane or sacred bonuses.

These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. Orisons prepared using other spell slots, such as those due to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats#TOC-Metamagic-Feats\">metamagic</a>&nbsp;feats, are expended normally.</p>\n<h2>Stern Gaze (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Inquisitors are skilled at sensing deception and intimidating their foes. An inquisitor receives a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Morale-Bonus\">morale bonus</a>&nbsp;on all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive\">Sense Motive</a>&nbsp;checks equal to 1/2 her inquisitor level (minimum +1).</p>\n<h2>Cunning Initiative (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;checks, in addition to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<h2>Detect Alignment (Sp)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, at will, an inquisitor can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-chaos\">detect chaos</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-evil\">detect evil</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-good\">detect good</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-law\">detect law</a>. She can only use one of these at any given time.</p>\n<h2>Track (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds half her level on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.</p>\n<h2>Solo Tactics (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, all of the inquisitor’s allies are treated as if they possessed the same teamwork feats as the inquisitor for the purpose of determining whether the inquisitor receives a bonus from her teamwork feats. Her allies do not receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually possess the feats themselves. The allies’ positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for the inquisitor to receive the listed bonus.</p>\n<h2>Teamwork Feat</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feats</a>. The inquisitor must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat.</p>\n<p>As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, the inquisitor can choose to learn a new bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>&nbsp;in place of the most recent bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>&nbsp;she has already learned. In effect, the inquisitor loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can only change the most recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>&nbsp;gained. Whenever she gains a new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>, the previous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>&nbsp;becomes set and cannot be changed again. An inquisitor can change her most recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/teamwork-feats\">teamwork feat</a>&nbsp;a number of times per day equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<h2>Bane (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, an inquisitor can imbue one of her weapons with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/bane/\">bane weapon special ability</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. She must select one creature type when she uses this ability (and a subtype if the creature type selected is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid\">humanoid</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider\">outsider</a>). Once selected, the type can be changed as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>. This ability only functions while the inquisitor wields the weapon. If dropped or taken, the weapon resumes granting this ability if it is returned to the inquisitor before the duration expires. This ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to the inquisitor’s level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>\n<h2>Discern Lies (Sp)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, an inquisitor can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/discern-lies\">discern lies</a>, as per the spell, for a number of rounds per day equal to her inquisitor level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. Activating this ability is an immediate action.</p>\n<h2>Second Judgement (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 8th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she selects two different judgments, instead of one. This only consumes one use of her judgment ability. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, she can change one of these judgments to another type.</p>\n<h2>Stalwart (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, an inquisitor can use mental and physical resiliency to avoid certain attacks. If she makes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\">Will</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, she instead avoids the effect entirely. This ability can only be used if the inquisitor is wearing light&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or no armor. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>&nbsp;inquisitor does not gain the benefit of the stalwart ability.</p>\n<h2>Greater Bane (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 12th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her bane ability, the amount of bonus damage dealt by the weapon against creatures of the selected type increases to 4d6.</p>\n<h2>Exploit Weakness (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, the inquisitor learns to take advantage of any opportunity that presents itself. Whenever the inquisitor scores a critical hit, she ignores any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;the target might have. In addition, if the target has regeneration, the creature loses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-\">regeneration</a>&nbsp;on the round following the critical hit and can die normally during that round. Creatures whose&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-\">regeneration</a>&nbsp;always functions are immune to this ability. Finally, if the inquisitor deals energy damage to a creature with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Immunity-and-Vulnerability\">vulnerability</a>&nbsp;to that energy type, she deals +1 point of damage per die rolled.</p>\n<h2>Third Judgement (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 16th level, whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she selects three different judgments, instead of just two. This only consumes one use of her judgment ability. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, the inquisitor can change one of these judgments to another type.</p>\n<h2>Slayer (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, an inquisitor learns to focus her judgment. Whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she must select one type of judgment. She is treated as if she were 5 levels higher for the purposes of determining the bonus granted by this judgment. Unlike other types of judgment, the one enhanced by this ability cannot be changed for the remainder of the judgment.</p>\n<h2>True Judgement (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, an inquisitor can call true judgment down upon a foe during combat. Whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, the inquisitor can invoke true judgment on a foe as a swift action. Once declared, the inquisitor can make a single melee (or ranged attack, if the foe is within 30 feet) against the target. If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the target must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor’s level + the inquisitor’s Wisdom modifier. Regardless of whether or not the save is made, the target creature is immune to the inquisitor’s true judgment ability for 24 hours. Once this ability has been used, it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"attackParts":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Wizard"},"sort":400001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/D35E/icons/items/inventory/book-red.jpg"}

She can’t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/read-magic\">read magic</a>&nbsp;(which all arcanists can prepare from memory).</p>\n<p>An arcanist begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard</a>/<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerer</a>&nbsp;spells plus three 1st-level spells of her choice. The arcanist also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizards</a>‘&nbsp;or other arcanists’&nbsp;spellbooks to her own.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Arcanists can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on&nbsp;Table: Arcanist Spells Prepared. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume spell slots. As with her other spells, these spells are not expended when cast.</p>\n<h2>Arcane Reservoir (Su)</h2>\n<p>An arcanist has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her arcanist exploits and enhance her spells. The arcanist’s arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to 3 + the arcanist’s level. Each day, when preparing spells, the arcanist’s arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 her arcanist level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume spells class feature and some arcanist exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.</p>\n<p>Points from the arcanist reservoir are used to fuel many of the arcanist’s powers. In addition, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;whenever she casts an arcanist spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;by 1 or increase the spell’s DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.</p>\n<h2>Arcane Exploits</h2>\n<p>By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist’s level + the arcanist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>For a complete list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/arcane-exploits\">Arcanist Exploits, see here</a></p>\n<h2>Consume Spells (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, an arcanist can expend an available arcanist spell slot as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>, making it unavailable for the rest of the day, just as if she had used it to cast a spell.&nbsp;She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier (minimum 1).&nbsp;Doing this adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to the level of the spell slot consumed. She cannot consume cantrips (0 level spells) in this way. Points gained in excess of the reservoir’s maximum are lost.</p>\n<h2>Greater Exploits</h2>\n<p>At 11th level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist can choose one of the following greater exploits in place of an arcanist exploit.</p>\n<p>For a complete list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist/arcanist-greater-exploits/\">Greater Exploits, see here</a></p>\n<h2>Magical Supremacy (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the arcanist learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she has prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending a spell slot. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"attackParts":[],"contextNotes":[],"identifiedName":"Sorcerer"},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"systems/D35E/icons/spells/runes-blue-2.jpg"}

This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#critical-hits\">critical hit</a>&nbsp;with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.</p>\n<p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty.</p>\n<p>The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.</p>\n<h2>Trapfinding</h2>\n<p>A rogue adds 1/2 her level to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\">Perception</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills#skill-checks\">skill checks</a>&nbsp;made to locate traps and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills#skill-checks\">skill checks</a>&nbsp;(minimum +1).

If she makes a successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#saving-throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#helpless\">helpless</a>&nbsp;rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>\n<h2>Rogue Talents</h2>\n<p>As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes.
